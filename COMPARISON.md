Netsukuku
=========

The best comparison for Airnet is to netsukuku. Netsukuku has extremely similar goals to Airnet (mesh networking, keypair auth).

 - Netsukuku aims to replace the internet layer. Airnet uses it as just one of many transports.
 - Airnet is written in C++ and attempts to be as lightweight and modular as possible.

Some things are borrowed from Netsukuku, but I felt the best approach was to implement something from scratch.
